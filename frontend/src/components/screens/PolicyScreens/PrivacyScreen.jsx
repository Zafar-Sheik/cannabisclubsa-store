            Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used
            Introduction
          </Card.Title>
          <Card.Text>
            Cannabis Club SA collects information in different ways from
            Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services
            and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use
            this information primarily to provide a customised experience as you
            use our Products and Services and generally, we do not share this
            information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal
            information collected if we have received your permission beforehand
            or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such
            disclosure is required by law or other special cases described
            below.

          <Card.Title>Registration</Card.Title>
          <Card.Text>
            Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when
            they sign up for our Products including name, address, telephone
            number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the
            type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The
            personal information collected from Members during the registration
            process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing
            purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless
            specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. However,
            in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our
            Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information,
            such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to
            the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose
            of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the
            promotion. In this instance, personal information may not be used by
            the partner for any other purpose. We may also generate
            non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information
            Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but
            not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we
            may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell
            advertisements that appear on the Services.
          </Card.Text>
          <Card.Title>Online Advertisements</Card.Title>
          <Card.Text>
            Our company may display our online advertisements. In those cases we
            share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors
            and Members collected through the registration process as well as
            through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.
            Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and
            non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements or
            joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company
            tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an
            advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated
            and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then
            display or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Our
            company does not share personal information about its Visitors or
            Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.

          <Card.Title>Responses to Email Inquiries</Card.Title>
          <Card.Text>
            When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, the
            return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive.
            Our company does not use the return email address for any other
            purpose and does not share the return email address with any third
            party.
          </Card.Text>
          <Card.Title>Special Cases</Card.Title>
          <Card.Text>
            It is our company's policy not to use or share the personal
            information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the ones
            described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out
            or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose
            personal information about Visitors or Members or information
            regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through
            our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe
            that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies;
            collection agencies; merchant database agencies; law enforcement, or
            to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act,
            the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal
            requests for such information; to disclose information that is
            necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against
            someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of
            Service, or other user policies; to operate the Services properly;
            or to protect our company and our Members.
