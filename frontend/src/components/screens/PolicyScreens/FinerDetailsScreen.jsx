          <Card.Title>Delivery of Products</Card.Title>
          <Card.Text>
            Delivery of any Products purchased on the Website will only take
            place after the Provider has received payment in full for such
            Products. The Provider will supply purchased Products to a third
            party courier of its choosing for the purposes of delivery of
            purchased Products, in good order and condition. The Provider's
            obligation to deliver a product to a User is fulfilled when the
            Product is delivered to the physical address nominated by the User
            for delivery of an order. The Provider will not be responsible for
            any loss or unauthorised use of a Product, after the product has
            been delivered to the physical address nominated by the User. In
            certain instances, and should a User elect, Products will be
            available for collection. Once a collection order for Products has
            been processed, the User will be notified via email of a collection
            address and date. All collections must be made within 3 (three)
            business days from email notification. Should a User fail to collect
            an order within (three) business days of receipt of such
            notification, the Provider reserves its rights to cancel such order
            and claim any damages it might may have suffered from the User.
          </Card.Text>
          <Card.Title>Refund and Return Policy</Card.Title>
          <Card.Text>

            unavailability, the Provider will refund the User in full within 30
            (thirty) days of date of order. The Provider reserves the right to
            cancel an order for which payment has already been received. A
            cancellation may occur in instances of insufficient stock or if the
            Provider is not satisfied the quality of goods ordered. Should the
            Provider exercise the right to cancel an order/delivery, the User
            will receive a full refund without any deductions. In the case of
            returns of orders by the User, the User will be responsible for
            actual shipping costs which will be incurred by the Provider and
            will pay to the Provider such costs prior to the Provider
            authorising the return of such Products.

            hereof, from time to time. Changes to the Terms & Conditions will
